= COMP3071: Introduction to Programming Languages

== September 1

=== Introduce yourself

Welcome! Let's get to know each other with an icebreaker. Answer these questions:

* What is your name?
* Why is Computer Science your major?
* Tell us something nobody else in the room knows about you.

=== About this course
This course introduces programming languages (hence the name) beyond the
familiar structured imperative object-oriented and procedural
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm[programming paradigms].

We'll have a midterm, labs and assignments, but for the final project,
we'll implement a compiler or interpreter for a programming language.

We'll focus on a few languages in depth, and cover other languages briefly.
Please download SWI-Prolog, Haskell Platform and SBCL (links in table).

== September 3

=== Install programming languages and a text editor

Download SWI-Prolog, Haskell Platform and SBCL (links in table above),
if you haven't already done so.

NOTE: Mac users may need to install http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/[XQuartz]

Install a decent text editor (e.g., https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++], https://atom.io/[Atom]).

=== Install Git and frontends

Windows:: https://git-scm.com/download/win[Install Git for Windows]
+
https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/releases/latest[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Select KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/starterupper/images/openssh.png[Choose OpenSSH]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev], then https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[Install XCode developer tools] which ships with git (recommended) or http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

Don't forget a https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.2.html[text editor].

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below.
Press `Shift-Insert` to paste in Git Bash.

----
curl https://gitlab.com/lawrancej/COMP3071-2015/raw/master/main.sh | bash

=== Intermission

Let's catch our breath.

=== Preliminaries

A *set* is unordered and has no duplicates (no repeated values).

----
{ "hello", "world" } == { "world", "hello" }
----

A *bag* is unordered and allows duplicates (repeated values).

----
{ "buffalo", "my", "buffalo" } == { "my", "buffalo", "buffalo" }
----

A *sequence* is ordered and allows duplicates.

----
[ "hello", "cruel", "world" ] != [ "cruel", "world", "hello" ]
----

An *ordered set* is ordered and has no duplicates.

To summarize:

=== Languages

English subset

----
{
    "This is a sentence in English.",
    "This is another sentence in English."
}
----

Espanol subseto?

----
{
    "Yo quiero Taco Bell",
    "Donde esta el bano?"
}
----

An *alphabet* is a set of symbols (e.g., `char`).
A *string* is a sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet.

*Languages* are (possibly infinite) sets of strings.
A *grammar* constructs a language; *regular expressions* construct *regular* languages.

=== Regular expressions

----
cd ~/COMP3071-2015
# Hexadecimal words
grep -E "^[a-f]+$" american-english.txt | less
----

A *regular expression* (regex) defines a language with these primitives and operators.

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Notation |Meaning

|*Primitives*
|
|Regular expression building block.

|*Empty Set*
|{}
|Reject everything.

|*Empty String*
|+""+
|Match the empty string.

|*Symbol*
|`a`
|Match a single character.

|*Operator*
|
|Make a new regex from existing regexes.

|*Sequence*
|`ab`
|Match regex `a` followed by regex `b`.

|*Alternation*
|`a\|b`
|Match regex `a` or match regex `b`, but not both.

|*Kleene Star*
|`a*`
|Match regex `a` zero or more times {+""+,`a`,`aa`,`aaa`,...}

|===

The primitives and operators above can define other regular expression operators
in terms of themselves.
For example, `a?` optionally matches `a`. This is equivalent to: `a|""`.
Another example: `a+` matches `a` 1 or more times. This is equivalent to `a*a`.

Trivially, finite languages are regular:

----
finite language:  {"hello","cruel","world"}
equivalent regex: hello|cruel|world
----

Since regular languages can be infinite, they encompass the finite languages.

----
.* (Matches everything)
----

Regular languages can't express everything; 
for example, they cannot check matching brackets in the general case.

=== Chomsky hierarchy of languages

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of languages.
What distinguishes one language category from another is
restrictions placed on grammars or the underlying automaton.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/chomsky-hierarchy.png[Chomsky hierarchy]

A *grammar* consists of a finite set of nonterminals (variables),
a starting nonterminal, terminals (literals, words or symbols),
and productions (rules) that map among terminals and nonterminals.
Grammars define languages: they generate the set of strings in the language
and test membership of a string in the language.

The example grammar below defines a small subset of English, with an example sentence.
The example grammar is context-free because the left side of each arrow is a nonterminal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog[Prolog] is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming[logic programming language].
Prolog typically compiles into code for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine[WAM]

In SWI-Prolog, File -> Consult `~/COMP3071-2015/in-class/intro.pl` for an introduction to Prolog syntax.
Open the same file in an editor, and run queries.

== September 8

Prolog stuff.

== September 10

Even more Prolog stuff.

== September 11

=== Lab 1

*Due*: By next Friday at the latest.
Save your work in a file called `lab1.pl` in your repo.

----
cd ~/COMP3017-2015
touch lab1.pl
----

NOTE: Use
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html[a proper text editor],
https://atom.io[such as this].

=== Trains

----
directTrain(avon, braintree).
directTrain(quincy,avon).
directTrain(newton,boston).
directTrain(boston,avon).
directTrain(braintree,milton).
directTrain(westwood,newton).
directTrain(canton, westwood).
----

This knowledge base holds facts about towns it is possible to travel between by taking a direct train.
But of course, we can travel further by chaining together direct train journeys.
Write a recursive predicate `travelBetween/2` that tells us when we can travel by train between two towns.

*Example*: `travelBetween(canton,braintree).` Prolog should reply `true`

*Example*: Whenever it is possible to take a direct train from A to B,
it is also possible to take a direct train from B to A.
For example, query `travelBetween(braintree, canton).` should return `true`.

=== Translation

----
tran(eins,one).
tran(zwei,two).
tran(drei,three).
tran(vier,four).
tran(fuenf,five).
tran(sechs,six).
tran(sieben,seven).
tran(acht,eight).
tran(neun,nine).
----

Write a predicate `listtran(G,E)` which translates a list of German number words to the corresponding list of English number words.

*Example*: `listtran([eins,neun,zwei],X).` should yield: `X = [one,nine,two].`

Your program should also work in the other direction. 

*Example*: `listtran(X,[one,seven,six,two]).` should yield: `X = [eins,sieben,sechs,zwei].`

*Hint*: Handle the base case (the empty list) first, then for non-empty lists, first translate the head of the list, and then use recursion to translate the tail.

=== Logic puzzle

Use Prolog to solve a logic puzzle, by encoding facts as predicates.
